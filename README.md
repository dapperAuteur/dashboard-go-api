# Dashboard App

This is the api to a dashboard app. The dashboard will track expenses, income, assets, tasks, and growth of the user.

It's written in Golang following the Ardan Labs way of building a service.

The goal is to build a tool that adds value to the users life, mine. And to help me get one of those high paying Golang dev jobs!
